    * Pass all tests 3
    * Each test case has individual weightage, total is 10

* First 3 submissions are penalty free.
* 4th submission deducts 5 from final score
* 5th submission deducts 10 from final score
* 6th submission deducts 15 from final score

## Deadline for submission
* Refer to the greadable for timelines
* Server is running on UTC and hence it will show 6.3 hours additional to the actual time.
